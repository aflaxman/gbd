Coding Practices
================

Write tests before code
Write equations before tests

Test quantitatively with simulation data
Test qualitatively with real data
Automate tests

Use a package instead of DIY
Test the package

Optimize code later
Optimize code for readability before speed

.py files should be short, less than 500 lines
Functions should be short, less than 25 lines
